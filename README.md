# SFaceDetection
Simple face recognition using opencv

This project is my first step into OpenCV. 
This project is dedicated to face recognition in images and videos. For face recognition, 
it is planned to use the Viola-Jones algorithm. 
I plan to use both ready-made Haar cascades and create my own.
